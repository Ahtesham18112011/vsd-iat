Specification- tells what the chip have to do 

Synthesis- The stage where the RTL code is converted into a gate-level netlist

Physical design- a critical phase in the integrated circuit design process, responsible for transforming a circuit's logical description into a layout that can be fabricated on a silicon wafer.

Sign-off timing analysis - breaks down the design into various timing paths, meticulously calculating signal propagation delays and checking for violations of timing constraints, such as setup and hold times.

Physical verification - a process whereby an integrated circuit layout design is verified via EDA software tools to ensure correct electrical and logical functionality and manufacturability.

GDSII Tapeout- GDSII files are usually the final output product of the IC design cycle and are handed over to IC foundries for IC fabrication.
